# Notes file for Helpers

This file is to hold notes about issues that you find learners have in the classroom, and how to help them quickly. If you find more than 2 or 3 people have similar issues,
please make a note in here so that future helpers can use your experience to help resolve issues quickly and get learners back on track.

Instructor resources for Data Carpentry workshops

This repository is intended to hold resources for instructors in the LDEV data carpentry workshops, including:

- Presentation slides
- Curriculum notes
- Notes on good practice / special situations

The goal is to build up a shared library of resources for both current and future instructors, and minimise the "resource sprawl" that can occur.
So please deposit your files and notes here, in the **BRANCH CORRESPONDING TO EACH RUN OF THE COURSE**

Instructions for using thie repo:

1. **BEFORE** the course
  - **HOST** to create a branch (from *main*) named according to the official Carpentries slug format eg 2025-02-13-TUD
  - Distribute the URL of this branch to instructors
  - **INSTRUCTORS** Make sure you can access the repo; add any class resources you plan to use in the relevant directory. Ensure you can commit, and engage with host if there are permissions problems
  - Ensure that you can access the corresponding learners' repository (add URL) and set up any learners' resources, set up and test gitautopush etc.
  - **UPDATE LINKS** in the learners repository to resources like the shared Google Docs, course website, daily schedule etc.
2. **DURING** the course
  - Keep resources up to date both here and in the learners' repo.
  - Periodically check whether gitautopush is actually pushing into the learne's repo
  - At the end of each session, do any organising / editing of autopushed contents that you feel would help students reviewing the material,
3. **AFTER** the course
  - At the course review meeting, assess whether any of the materials (eg. changed curriculum notes, slide decks, cheat sheets etc.) should be merged into *main*
  - **HOST** to coordinate merging these materials into *main* so that they become automatically available in future branches.
